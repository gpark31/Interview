/* 
    Quick sort: picks a random element as a pivot and then swaps values in the array such that the elements less than pivot appear before elements greater than pivot
    
    Time Complexity
        Best Case: when all elements are equal, O(N)
        Worst Case: pivot is repeatedly the biggest element in the array O(n^2)
        Expected Case: O(N log N)

    Space Complexity
        O(N)

    Recursive algorithms take at least O(n) space, where n is the depth of the c
